# Road-Lane-Detection
_**The objective of the Road Lane Detection Project is to accurately identify and delineate lane boundaries on the road. This task is crucial for a variety of applications related to road navigation and driving safety. The project is implemented using Python programming language in conjunction with the OpenCV computer vision library.**_

_**Description:**_

Lane detection is the process of identifying the lane boundaries on the road. It is an essential task for autonomous driving systems and driver assistance systems.
These systems use computer vision algorithms to detect lane markings and determine the vehicleâ€™s position relative to the lane boundaries.

_**Applications of Lane Detection:**_

1. Advanced Driver Assistance system
2.  Autonomous Vehicles
3.  Traffic Monitoring and Control
4.  Road sign recognition
5.  Video Surveillance

_**Techiniques Used:**_

1. Gray Scale Conversion
2. Gaussian Blur
3. Edge Detection
4. Hough Transform
5. Region Of Interest

_**Flow Chart:**_

The below is the flow chart showing the steps involved in Road Lane Detection using Open CV and Python:
