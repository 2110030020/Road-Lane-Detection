# Road-Lane-Detection
Road Lane Detection Project using Python and OpenCV

Lane detection is the process of identifying the lane boundaries on the road. It is an essential task for autonomous driving systems and driver assistance systems.
These systems use computer vision algorithms to detect lane markings and determine the vehicleâ€™s position relative to the lane boundaries.
Applications of Lane Detection:
1. Advanced Driver Assistance system
2.  Autonomous Vehicles
3.  Traffic Monitoring and Control
4.  Road sign recognition
5.  Video Surveillance
